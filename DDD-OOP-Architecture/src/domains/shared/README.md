# ♻️ shared/ (shared domain)

This folder contains **reusable domain logic** and **building blocks** that can be used across multiple domains.  
It may include common value objects, utility classes, types, and constants that are not tied to a single bounded context.

---

## ✅ Best practices

- Keep shared code **generic and reusable**
- Do **not** include business rules specific to a single domain
- Use clear and consistent naming
- Ensure changes in shared code do not break dependent domains
