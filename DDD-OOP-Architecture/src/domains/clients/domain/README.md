# ðŸ§  domain/ (clients domain)

This folder defines the **core business logic** of the `clients` domain.  
It includes **entities**, **value objects**, and **aggregates** that encapsulate domain rules.

These are pure classes, decoupled from any framework or infrastructure.

---

## âœ… Best practices

- Use **constructors**, **methods**, and **invariants**
- Keep logic encapsulated in the entity
- Do **not** access DB or APIs directly here
